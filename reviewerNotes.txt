The bot can listen to you and take notes and save it - it won't respond when it is in listening mode until you tell it to 'stop listening' or 'that's it'
The flow is like: 
= NOTES =
- tell bot you want to take a note
- write your note messages (separate messages if you'd like) or send a photo of something handwritten. 
- tell bot that you're done / stop listening or anything relevant (like: I'm done, that's it...)
- tell bot to 'show your notes'  > gets latest 10 entries in a carousell.
- you can Read/Delete the note if you'd like.

= ENTERTAINMENT = 
- tell the bot you want a video / song / gif for something you'd like (ex: 'show me a funny cat video' or 'show me a lady gaga gif')
- Reponse will be the media you asked. 
- tell/ask the bot to play the selfie game
