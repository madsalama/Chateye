    - You're building an interesting working prototype! - 
    - Focus on UX/Usability instead of number of features - 
    - Main tasks - improving AI - completing integrations (YT/TWITTER/INSTA)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

= What should I do with the data? = 'STATEFUL'
    - Favorites: Entertainment (movies/actors/music/singers) | Save preferences. 
    - Offer better suggestions as I learn user's preferences. 
    (using media tags on different media channels Youtube/Insta/Twitter/MusicXmatch/etc.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

= What should I do with the data? = 'STATEFUL'
    - detects emotions in text.
    - detects emotions in emojis.
    - detects emotions in an uploaded selfie.

        A1 = Form a total emotional state. (On a scale from 1:10).
        A2 = Form an emotional diary for that specific user. (STATEFUL)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
= API.AI should be fed back user responses and be customized for that user = 'STATEFUL'
(User persistent/preference data is stored in mongoDB? - or just fed up to dynamically improve AI model?)

= API.AI = 
    - Define CONTEXTS -
        - GREETING user only at the start of every session.
        - LISTENING to user | when to offer help. (emotional/entertain)
        - HELPING user feel better by emotionally sympathizing/empathizing. 
        - ENTERTAINING user according to their preferences.
