https://medium.muz.li/the-ultimate-guide-to-chatbots-why-thâ€¦
-3- Media response is relating to latest note emotion.

-0- Fix Audio feature - add something related to Audio entity recognition! 

< tell something > - get a definition!
-1- Mix and match emotions for better analysis (store all major emotions instead of only one major)
-- use that information to save user's mood (average - trend - graph?)
-- use a set of notes to detect user's personality (IBM natural tone analysis - personality - etc )
-2- More than 10 items per carousel. (a 'view more' carousel item)

- FUTURE -
-- CREATE a singalong game - where it suggests songs and shows a summary of lyrics to sing along! <3 
-4- Extract information/entities from the notes to better sympathize with the person's preferences. (watson NLU)
-- store these preferences to provide a customized experience. (mongoDB)
-- in time, an interaction profile is created for the specific user. (mongoDB)
-- in time, the application should use a machine learning model to improve and dynamically interpret user's intentions 
and also generate more responses and update (API.AI) intent model with those responses.
